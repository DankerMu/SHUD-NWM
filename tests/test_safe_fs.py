"""L1 evidence for `directory_identity_no_follow` (#1192).

What this file proves: the helper consumes **inode identity**, not the input
string.  Every case here runs against a real filesystem, needs no root, and is
portable to Linux (CI, node-27) as well as macOS.

HONEST LIMIT -- read before adding cases.  This layer does **not** prove that
two paths existing *at the same time* under different realpaths report one
identity.  That shape is a bind mount or a second mount point of one export,
and there is no portable, root-free construction for it: directories cannot be
hardlinked, `Path.resolve()` folds symlink aliases away, the no-follow walk
refuses a symlink final component outright, and macOS case-folding aliases are
two distinct directories on Linux.  The rename pair below is **sequential** --
one inode seen at two realpaths one after the other -- not concurrent.  The
guard-level claim is carried by the injection tests in
tests/test_scheduler_state_index_copyback_replay.py,
tests/test_run_tree_copyback.py, tests/test_tile_publisher.py and
tests/test_forcing_copyback_backfill.py, plus the POSIX same-superblock
argument recorded in the change proposal.
