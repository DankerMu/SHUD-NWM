# Failed Basin Retry Alert Runbook

## Preconditions

- Confirm the alert payload includes `nhms_failed_basin_retry_count`, basin/model ID, job ID, and run ID.
- Preserve stdout, stderr, manifest, and QC evidence before retrying.

## Commands

```bash
uv run nhms-production validate-slurm --evidence-root artifacts/production-closure --run-id failed-basin-retry-check --fake-slurm
uv run pytest -q tests/test_shud_runtime.py tests/test_production_slurm_validation.py
```

## Expected Evidence

- `slurm/array_partial_success.json` keeps successful sibling outputs immutable.
- `slurm/retry_cancel.json` records retry status and cancellation semantics.
- `ops/monitoring_alerts.json` records the breached retry threshold.

## Recovery Steps

1. Classify the failed basin error from stderr and QC evidence.
2. Retry failed-only tasks when the error is transient.
3. Quarantine failed outputs if retry is not safe, while retaining successful sibling artifacts.

## Residual Risks

Repeated basin failures may indicate model input defects. Do not publish affected downstream frequency or tile outputs until QC is accepted.
