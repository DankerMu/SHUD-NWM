## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Shell wrapper changes MUST gate their guard suites

The CI change-detection gate SHALL treat tracked `scripts/**/*.sh` files as
backend surface: the `backend` paths-filter matches them, and the targeted
test selector maps each shell wrapper that has committed guard tests to those
guard test files. A `scripts/**/*.sh` path with no explicit mapping falls back
to the core smoke selection instead of an empty selection.

#### Scenario: sh-only change selects the wrapper's guard suite

WHEN a pull request changes only `scripts/scheduler_file_provider_refresh_once.sh`
THEN the `backend` filter reports true
AND the targeted selector output includes `tests/test_scheduler_file_provider_refresh.py`

#### Scenario: unmapped shell script falls back loudly, not empty

WHEN a pull request changes only a new `scripts/**/*.sh` file that has no
selector mapping
THEN the targeted selector returns at least the core smoke test set
AND does not return an empty selection

#### Scenario: sh plus py change selects the union of guards

WHEN a pull request changes both a mapped shell wrapper and a mapped backend
python module
THEN the targeted selector output contains both surfaces' guard suites

#### Scenario: a mapped shell wrapper does not pull core smoke

WHEN a pull request changes only a shell wrapper that has an explicit guard
mapping
THEN the selection contains its guard suite and no core-smoke fallback entries

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Empty targeted-test selection MUST be loudly self-identifying

The `Unit Tests` job's collect-only fallback SHALL be independently
recognizable as a zero-assertion run whenever the PR backend gate is open
but the targeted-test selector maps the diff to zero test files: it MUST
emit a workflow
warning annotation and a step summary stating that no assertions were
executed, and the collection outcome MUST be surfaced in the job log — the
collected-count summary on success and the full collection output on
failure, with a collection failure still failing the step. The selector SHALL
NOT silently shrink its selection: when a rule-selected test target no
longer exists in the tree, the selector MUST emit a warning naming the
dropped target (stderr always; a workflow warning annotation when running
under GitHub Actions) while keeping its return-value semantics unchanged.
The collect-only branch's check name and pass/fail semantics are unchanged
by this requirement (gate-strength changes are out of scope).
Additionally, when the final selection collapses to exactly the selector
meta-guard suite (`meta_guard_only` — a selection-shape property that
also fires for selector-development PRs whose diff-specific target is
that suite), the selector SHALL expose the collapse as a
distinguishable GitHub-output field and the `Unit Tests` job SHALL run
the targeted selection AND the labeled full-tree collect-only smoke,
whose labeling on this branch MUST NOT claim zero assertions were
executed; a PR whose only backend change deletes a test file (or
touches only a `tests/` support module without derived non-gated
importer suites) thereby keeps the import-surface guard it had
before the meta-guard accumulation existed. Support modules WITH
derived non-gated importer suites are governed by the requirement
"Support-module changes MUST select their non-gated importer
suites", which routes them to assertion-level targets instead of
this collapse path.

#### Scenario: collect-only fallback is labeled as zero assertions

- **WHEN** a PR hits the `backend` paths-filter but the selector returns
  zero test files (e.g. a `schemas/**`-only change)
- **THEN** the `Unit Tests` job run shows a warning annotation and a step
  summary stating that 0 assertions were executed and only collect-only
  import/syntax smoke ran, and the pytest collected-count summary appears
  in the job log (full collection output on failure, which fails the step)

#### Scenario: stale rule target is dropped with a warning, not silently

- **WHEN** a selection rule maps a changed path to a test file that does
  not exist in the tree
- **THEN** the selector drops the target from its output but emits a
  warning naming the missing target, and emits no such warning when every
  selected target exists

#### Scenario: known empty-selection input classes are pinned

- **WHEN** the diff consists only of files in the known unmapped classes
  (`schemas/**`, unmapped `infra/**`, `.py` outside the five backend
  prefixes, non-`.py` under backend prefixes, non-`.py` under `tests/`,
  `.sh` files outside `scripts/`; `scripts/**/*.sh` left this list when it
  joined the backend gate — an unmapped one now arms the core-smoke fallback)
- **THEN** the selector returns an empty selection and the selector test
  suite pins each class explicitly as the route-C contract, so any future
  route-A/B policy change must flip a visible assertion

#### Scenario: meta-guard-only collapse restores the collect-only smoke

- **WHEN** a PR's only backend change deletes one `tests/test_*.py` file,
  so the missing-target filter leaves exactly
  `tests/test_select_ci_tests.py` in the selection
- **THEN** the selector's GitHub output reports `meta_guard_only=true`,
  and the `Unit Tests` job runs the meta-guard suite and additionally the
  labeled full-tree collect-only smoke, with a collection failure failing
  the step

#### Scenario: non-collapsed selections suppress the flag

- **WHEN** the selection contains any target other than the selector
  meta-guard suite, or is empty
- **THEN** the GitHub output reports `meta_guard_only=false` and the
  targeted branch behaves as before

#### Scenario: selector-development PRs fire the flag honestly

- **WHEN** the diff's only backend change is
  `scripts/select_ci_tests.py` or `tests/test_select_ci_tests.py`, so
  the diff-specific selection IS exactly the meta-guard suite
- **THEN** `meta_guard_only=true` and the collect-only smoke also runs
  — accepted by design (one extra collection pass on exactly the PR
  class that changes the gate), and the smoke labeling does not claim
  the run executed zero assertions
