# Delta: river-identity-normalization（issue #1339）

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: river_timeseries identity columns SHALL have integer surrogate-key targets with an idempotent, bounded, receipted backfill

The schema SHALL provide integer surrogate keys on the four existing
authority tables (`hydro.hydro_run`, `core.basin_version`,
`core.river_network_version`, `core.river_segment`), native enum types
for `variable`, `unit`, and `quality_flag`, and nullable normalized
columns on `hydro.river_timeseries` added without a table rewrite.
Backfill of existing rows SHALL run only through a bounded, receipted
runner that is dry-run by default, batches by ctid block ranges, is
resumable via a NULL-sentinel predicate plus a persisted block cursor,
enforces a per-batch transaction-duration wall, fails closed (with
distinguishable receipt counters) on authority-unmatched or
enum-unmappable values, and never issues DML against compressed chunks
or the active (currently ingested) chunk. The production compression
settings and primary key SHALL remain unchanged by this change;
switching both is delivered as a read-only verify function plus a
fail-closed cutover function that the migration chain never invokes.

#### Scenario: Migration replays idempotently without rewriting the fact table

- **WHEN** the migration chain through 000050 is applied twice to an
  empty database
- **THEN** both passes succeed, the four surrogate-key columns, three
  enum types, and seven nullable fact columns exist exactly once, and
  `pg_attribute.atthasmissing` is false for all seven new fact columns
  (no stored default, no rewrite)

#### Scenario: Backfill is re-entrant and bounded

- **WHEN** the backfill runner is interrupted after some batches and
  re-invoked
- **THEN** it resumes without re-updating rows whose sentinel key is
  already set (block cursor loss degrades to a full rescan with
  identical results), a second complete pass reports zero changed rows,
  every batch runs inside its own transaction bounded by the configured
  duration wall with one halved-range retry, and each invocation emits
  a schema-validated receipt

#### Scenario: Unresolvable values, compressed chunks, and the active chunk fail safe

- **WHEN** the runner detects a per-batch shortfall between sentinel
  candidates and updated rows (authority-unmatched or enum-unmappable
  values), or encounters a chunk reported compressed by the shared
  write-guard's chunk assertion, or the active chunk
- **THEN** the shortfall stops the run fail-closed with distinguishable
  receipt counters (never silently left as progress), compressed and
  active chunks receive no UPDATE and are listed in the receipt as
  skipped, and the documented recovery paths are the existing
  decompression-replay/compression runners (compressed) and either a
  later catch-up round once the chunk is terminal or an explicit
  final-sweep invocation that first asserts ingest is quiescent
  (active)

#### Scenario: Cutover is a fail-closed single-transaction window operation, never auto-applied

- **WHEN** `hydro.cutover_river_identity_normalization()` is invoked
  with any compressed chunk present, or with any NULL remaining in the
  seven normalized columns
- **THEN** it raises an error and changes nothing (a compressed chunk
  fails the explicit precondition; a NULL fails the in-transaction
  VALIDATE CONSTRAINT step, rolling everything back); only inside a
  maintenance window — ingest paused, final sweep done, read-only
  verify counts at zero, all chunks decompressed — does it execute the
  measured working sequence in one transaction: disable compression,
  drop the text foreign key (measured TimescaleDB 2.10 rule: foreign
  key columns must be covered by segmentby∪orderby, so the text FK
  cannot survive integer segmentby), validate NOT NULL via check
  constraints then set the seven columns NOT NULL scan-free, replace
  the primary key with the integer/enum form (in-window index build),
  and re-enable compression with segmentby/orderby on the normalized
  columns (TimescaleDB 2.10 requires segmentby∪orderby to cover the
  primary-key columns, so the two switches are inseparable), after
  which a compress/decompress round-trip preserves row data; the
  migration chain itself never calls the verify or cutover functions,
  keeping CI and production schemas convergent
