# Spec Delta: hypertable-compression

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The replay arm MUST have a committed pre-arm reset that archives residue without deleting and fails closed on unsafe conditions

The controlled-replay arm SHALL be preceded by a committed pre-arm
reset script that moves the previous arm's supervisor-owned residue
into a timestamped archive directory, never deleting anything, keeping
only the two files the next arm requires in place (the run plan and
the expected-stale terminal receipt), and SHALL refuse to run — before
moving any file — when the replay unit is not inactive/failed, when an
existing terminal receipt's digest does not match the pinned
expected-stale digest, when the failure-intent family is unresolved,
or when the run plan is present but unreadable. The residue swept MUST
include the stale finalizer state and supervisor ledger (each would
abort the next arm on its exclusive-create refusal), and the resolved
intent-family residue is swept whole, never partially. The
supervisor's own refuse-to-overwrite trust boundary stays unchanged.

#### Scenario: Residue is archived and the next arm stays viable

- **WHEN** the pre-arm reset runs over a working directory containing
  stale checkpoint artifacts, a stale finalizer state, a stale
  supervisor ledger, and an existing plan-associated schema-dump file,
  alongside the run plan and the expected-stale terminal receipt
- **THEN** the stale artifacts, finalizer state, ledger, and
  schema-dump file are moved — content-intact — into a new timestamped
  archive directory with a manifest, while the run plan and terminal
  receipt remain in place

#### Scenario: Unsafe conditions refuse before any move

- **WHEN** the replay unit reports any state other than inactive or
  failed (including activating), or the existing terminal receipt's
  digest does not match the pinned expected-stale digest, or the
  failure-intent family shows a pending or consuming intent, or the
  run plan exists but is not valid JSON
- **THEN** the pre-arm reset exits non-zero naming the reason and the
  working directory is left byte-identical, with no archive directory
  created

#### Scenario: Re-running is safe and prior archives are preserved

- **WHEN** the pre-arm reset runs again after a previous invocation
  already produced an archive directory
- **THEN** the previous archive directory is not swept into the new
  one and remains intact, and a clean working directory yields a
  successful no-op that still prints the next arm step
