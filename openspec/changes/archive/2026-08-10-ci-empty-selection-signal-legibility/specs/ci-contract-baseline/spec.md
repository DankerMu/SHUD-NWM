## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Empty targeted-test selection MUST be loudly self-identifying

The `Unit Tests` job's collect-only fallback SHALL be independently
recognizable as a zero-assertion run whenever the PR backend gate is open
but the targeted-test selector maps the diff to zero test files: it MUST
emit a workflow
warning annotation and a step summary stating that no assertions were
executed, and the collection outcome MUST be surfaced in the job log — the
collected-count summary on success and the full collection output on
failure, with a collection failure still failing the step. The selector SHALL
NOT silently shrink its selection: when a rule-selected test target no
longer exists in the tree, the selector MUST emit a warning naming the
dropped target (stderr always; a workflow warning annotation when running
under GitHub Actions) while keeping its return-value semantics unchanged.
The collect-only branch's check name and pass/fail semantics are unchanged
by this requirement (gate-strength changes are out of scope).

#### Scenario: collect-only fallback is labeled as zero assertions

- **WHEN** a PR hits the `backend` paths-filter but the selector returns
  zero test files (e.g. a `schemas/**`-only change)
- **THEN** the `Unit Tests` job run shows a warning annotation and a step
  summary stating that 0 assertions were executed and only collect-only
  import/syntax smoke ran, and the pytest collected-count summary appears
  in the job log (full collection output on failure, which fails the step)

#### Scenario: stale rule target is dropped with a warning, not silently

- **WHEN** a selection rule maps a changed path to a test file that does
  not exist in the tree
- **THEN** the selector drops the target from its output but emits a
  warning naming the missing target, and emits no such warning when every
  selected target exists

#### Scenario: known empty-selection input classes are pinned

- **WHEN** the diff consists only of files in the known unmapped classes
  (`schemas/**`, unmapped `infra/**`, `.py` outside the five backend
  prefixes, non-`.py` under backend prefixes, non-`.py` under `tests/`,
  `scripts/**/*.sh`)
- **THEN** the selector returns an empty selection and the selector test
  suite pins each class explicitly as the route-C contract, so any future
  route-A/B policy change must flip a visible assertion
