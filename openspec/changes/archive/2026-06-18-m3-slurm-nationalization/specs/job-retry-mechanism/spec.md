**Change:** m3-slurm-nationalization  
**Spec:** 8 of 8 — job-retry-mechanism  
**Status:** draft  

---

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Manual Retry via API

The system SHALL support manual retry of failed runs through the monitoring API.

#### Scenario: Operator triggers manual retry

- **WHEN** a user with `operator`, `model_admin`, or `sys_admin` role sends `POST /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/retry`
- **THEN** the system SHALL:
  1. Identify the most recent `pipeline_job` records for the given `run_id` with `status` = `failed`
  2. For each failed job, create a new `pipeline_job` record with:
     - A new `job_id` (UUID)
     - The same `run_id` as the original job
     - A new `slurm_job_id` (assigned by Slurm upon submission)
     - `retry_count` incremented by 1 from the failed job's `retry_count`
     - `status` set to `submitted`
  3. Submit the new job to Slurm via `sbatch`
  4. Append a `pipeline_event` with `details_json` containing `{"trigger": "manual", "previous_job_id": "<failed_job_id>", "retry_count": <N>}`

#### Scenario: Manual retry allowed after max auto-retries exhausted

- **WHEN** a job has exhausted all automatic retries (i.e., `retry_count >= max_retries`) and a user with `operator+` role sends a manual retry
- **THEN** the system SHALL accept the retry request and create a new job (operator override)
- **THEN** the `pipeline_event.details_json` SHALL include `{"trigger": "manual_override", "note": "exceeded max_retries"}`

#### Scenario: Manual retry preserves run_id

- **WHEN** a manual retry is triggered for a `run_id`
- **THEN** the new `pipeline_job` SHALL use the same `run_id` as the original failed job
- **THEN** the new `pipeline_job` SHALL receive a new `slurm_job_id` from the fresh `sbatch` submission

---

### Requirement: Automatic Retry by Orchestrator

The Orchestrator SHALL automatically retry failed tasks up to a configurable maximum number of retries.

#### Scenario: Auto-retry on transient failure

- **WHEN** a `pipeline_job` transitions to `failed` with a transient error code and `retry_count < max_retries`
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL schedule a retry after the configured backoff delay
- **THEN** a new `pipeline_job` record SHALL be created with `retry_count` incremented by 1
- **THEN** a `pipeline_event` SHALL be appended with `details_json` containing `{"trigger": "auto", "previous_job_id": "<failed_job_id>", "retry_count": <N>, "error_code": "<original_error_code>"}`

#### Scenario: Default max_retries configuration

- **WHEN** the `slurm_gateway` configuration does not specify `max_retries`
- **THEN** the system SHALL default to `max_retries: 3`

#### Scenario: Per-model max_retries override

- **WHEN** a model's configuration specifies a custom `max_retries` value
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL use the model-specific value instead of the global default

---

### Requirement: Exponential Backoff Schedule

Retry delays SHALL follow a configured backoff schedule to avoid overwhelming Slurm with rapid resubmissions.

#### Scenario: Default backoff schedule

- **WHEN** the `slurm_gateway` configuration specifies `retry_backoff_seconds: [60, 300, 900]`
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL delay:
  - 1st retry: 60 seconds after failure
  - 2nd retry: 300 seconds after failure
  - 3rd retry: 900 seconds after failure

#### Scenario: Retry count exceeds backoff array length

- **WHEN** `retry_count` exceeds the length of the `retry_backoff_seconds` array (e.g., 4th retry with a 3-element array)
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL use the last element of the backoff array as the delay (i.e., 900 seconds)

#### Scenario: Backoff timer precision

- **WHEN** the Orchestrator schedules a retry with a backoff delay
- **THEN** the actual submission time SHALL be within +/- 5 seconds of the configured delay (accounting for scheduling jitter)

---

### Requirement: Retry Scope — Failed Basin Only

Retry SHALL target only the specific failed basin or task within an array job, not the entire array.

#### Scenario: Single basin failure in array job

- **WHEN** an array job for the `shud_forecast` stage completes with 1 of 128 basins failed
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL retry only the failed basin's task, creating a single new `pipeline_job` for that basin
- **THEN** the Orchestrator MUST NOT resubmit the entire 128-basin array

#### Scenario: Multiple basin failures in array job

- **WHEN** an array job completes with 5 of 128 basins failed
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL create 5 new `pipeline_job` records (one per failed basin) and submit them as individual jobs or as a new smaller array job
- **THEN** each retry job SHALL reference the original `run_id` and the specific `model_id` of the failed basin

#### Scenario: Cycle-level stage failure (non-array)

- **WHEN** a cycle-level stage (e.g., `download`) fails
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL retry the entire stage as a single job since it has no per-basin granularity

---

### Requirement: Retry Audit Logging

Each retry attempt MUST be logged to `ops.pipeline_event` for audit traceability.

#### Scenario: Auto-retry event logged

- **WHEN** the Orchestrator triggers an automatic retry
- **THEN** a `pipeline_event` record SHALL be appended with:
  - `job_id` — the new retry job's ID
  - `from_status` — NULL (new job)
  - `to_status` — `submitted`
  - `details_json` — containing:
    - `trigger` — `"auto"`
    - `previous_job_id` — the failed job's `job_id`
    - `retry_count` — the current retry attempt number
    - `previous_error_code` — the error code from the failed job
    - `previous_error_message` — truncated error message (max 500 chars)
    - `backoff_seconds` — the delay applied before this retry

#### Scenario: Manual retry event logged

- **WHEN** a user triggers a manual retry via the API
- **THEN** a `pipeline_event` record SHALL be appended with:
  - `details_json` containing:
    - `trigger` — `"manual"`
    - `operator_id` — the authenticated user's ID
    - `previous_job_id` — the failed job's `job_id`
    - `retry_count` — the current retry attempt number

---

### Requirement: Retry Guard — Non-Transient Error Exclusion

The Orchestrator SHALL NOT automatically retry jobs that failed with non-transient error codes.

#### Scenario: Non-transient error codes block auto-retry

- **WHEN** a `pipeline_job` fails with one of the following error codes:
  - `INVALID_MANIFEST` — manifest file is malformed or missing required fields
  - `PERMISSION_DENIED` — insufficient permissions to access resources
  - `OUTPUT_INCOMPLETE` — output schema validation failed (data integrity error, not retryable)
  - `TEMPLATE_NOT_ALLOWED` — sbatch template rejected by security policy
  - `MANIFEST_SCHEMA_INVALID` — manifest file fails JSON schema validation
  - `OUT_OF_MEMORY` — Slurm OOM kill (configuration error: memory_gb too low for workload, not transient)
- **THEN** the Orchestrator MUST NOT schedule an automatic retry
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL mark the job as permanently failed immediately
- **THEN** a `pipeline_event` SHALL be appended with `details_json` containing `{"auto_retry_skipped": true, "reason": "non_transient_error", "error_code": "<code>"}`

#### Scenario: Transient error codes allow auto-retry

- **WHEN** a `pipeline_job` fails with one of the following error codes:
  - `SLURM_TIMEOUT` — Slurm walltime exceeded
  - `NODE_FAILURE` — compute node crashed or became unreachable
  - `STORAGE_WRITE_FAILED` — transient storage I/O error
  - `SBATCH_SUBMISSION_FAILED` — sbatch command returned non-zero (transient Slurm scheduler issue)
  - `SLURM_UNAVAILABLE` — Slurm controller unreachable at submission time
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL proceed with automatic retry (subject to `max_retries` and backoff)

#### Scenario: Unknown error code defaults to non-transient

- **WHEN** a `pipeline_job` fails with an error code not listed in the non-transient or transient lists
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL treat it as non-transient and MUST NOT schedule an automatic retry
- **THEN** a `pipeline_event` SHALL be appended with `details_json` containing `{"auto_retry_skipped": true, "reason": "unknown_error_code_defaulted_non_transient", "error_code": "<code>"}`
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL log a warning: `"unknown error_code '<code>' defaulted to non-transient — add to classification list"`

---

### Requirement: Max Retries Exhausted — Permanent Failure

When all automatic retries are exhausted, the job MUST be marked as permanently failed and an alert triggered.

#### Scenario: All retries exhausted

- **WHEN** a `pipeline_job` fails and `retry_count >= max_retries`
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL:
  1. Set the job `status` to `permanently_failed`
  2. Append a `pipeline_event` with `details_json` containing `{"permanently_failed": true, "total_attempts": <N>, "final_error_code": "<code>"}`
  3. Trigger an alert notification (via configured alerting channel) with the job details, error history, and affected basin/model

#### Scenario: Permanently failed job does not block manual retry

- **WHEN** a job is in `permanently_failed` status
- **THEN** the job SHALL still be eligible for manual retry via `POST /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/retry` (operator override)
- **THEN** the operator override SHALL reset the context but preserve the full retry history in `pipeline_event`

---

### Requirement: Retry Identity — Same run_id, New slurm_job_id

Retry jobs SHALL maintain continuity with the original run while obtaining fresh Slurm resources.

#### Scenario: Retry preserves run_id

- **WHEN** a retry job is created (either manual or automatic)
- **THEN** the new `pipeline_job` SHALL use the same `run_id` as the original failed job
- **THEN** the new `pipeline_job` SHALL use the same `cycle_id`, `source`, `stage`, and `model_id` as the original

#### Scenario: Retry gets new slurm_job_id

- **WHEN** a retry job is submitted to Slurm
- **THEN** a new `slurm_job_id` SHALL be assigned by Slurm and stored in the new `pipeline_job` record
- **THEN** the original failed job's `slurm_job_id` SHALL remain unchanged for audit purposes

#### Scenario: Retry gets new job_id

- **WHEN** a retry job is created
- **THEN** a new `job_id` (UUID) SHALL be generated for the retry job
- **THEN** the relationship between original and retry jobs SHALL be traceable via `pipeline_event.details_json.previous_job_id`

---

### Requirement: Concurrent Retry Protection

The system SHALL prevent duplicate retry jobs from being created for the same run.

#### Scenario: Concurrent manual retry requests for same run_id

- **WHEN** two operators simultaneously send `POST /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/retry` for the same `run_id`
- **THEN** only one retry job SHALL be created and submitted to Slurm
- **THEN** the second request SHALL receive HTTP 409 with `{"request_id": "...", "status": "error", "error": {"code": "RETRY_ALREADY_IN_PROGRESS", "message": "A retry for this run is already in progress"}}`
- **THEN** the system SHALL enforce this via a database unique constraint or optimistic lock on `(run_id, status NOT IN terminal_states)`

#### Scenario: Auto-retry skipped when manual retry already active

- **WHEN** the Orchestrator's auto-retry scheduler fires for a failed job but a manual retry for the same `run_id` has already been submitted (status = `submitted` or `running`)
- **THEN** the Orchestrator SHALL detect the existing active retry and skip the auto-retry
- **THEN** a `pipeline_event` SHALL be appended with `details_json` containing `{"auto_retry_skipped": true, "reason": "manual_retry_already_active", "active_job_id": "<existing_retry_job_id>"}`
