# scheduler-registry-refresh Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change unify-cutover-gate-audit-normalizer. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: cutover_gate audit blocks MUST pass one shared strict normalizer on every persistence channel

Every persisted `cutover_gate` audit block — CLI summary, runner receipt, and manifest companion receipt — SHALL be produced by the single shared normalizer (`packages/scheduler/registry_audit.py`), which enforces the three-field shape (`mode` ∈ the audited mode set, `declaration_env` str-or-null, `declaration_present` bool) and rejects malformed input with error code `SCHEDULER_REGISTRY_CUTOVER_AUDIT_INVALID`; no channel may silently rewrite a malformed block to `"not_wired"`.

#### Scenario: Manifest channel is fail-closed on malformed audit input

- **WHEN** `publish_scheduler_registry_manifest` is called with a
  `cutover_gate` block that is not a Mapping, has `mode` outside the audited
  mode set, or has a non-string non-null `declaration_env`
- **THEN** the publish SHALL raise with error code
  `SCHEDULER_REGISTRY_CUTOVER_AUDIT_INVALID` before the manifest bytes are
  committed
- **AND** the destination manifest SHALL remain absent or unchanged

#### Scenario: Runner audit block survives to the manifest receipt verbatim

- **WHEN** `publish_all_basin_scheduler_registry` completes with a runner-built
  enforced audit block
- **THEN** the manifest companion receipt SHALL embed `cutover_gate` with
  `mode`, `declaration_env`, and `declaration_present` byte-for-byte equal to
  the producer's block

#### Scenario: Unwired CLI-aggregate callers record not_wired on both channels

- **WHEN** `publish_all_basin_scheduler_registry` is called with
  `cutover_gate=None`
- **THEN** the CLI summary SHALL record the
  `{"mode": "not_wired", "declaration_env": null,
  "declaration_present": false}` fallback
- **AND** the manifest companion receipt SHALL carry the same `not_wired`
  block, because the aggregate entry point normalizes at its boundary before
  delegating (existing behavior; this change adds the pinning assertion)

#### Scenario: Direct manifest-publisher callers keep the key-omitting shape

- **WHEN** `publish_scheduler_registry_manifest` is called directly with
  `cutover_gate=None` (the worker-mirror, require-direct-grid, and
  direct-grid provisioning callers)
- **THEN** the manifest companion receipt SHALL omit the `cutover_gate` key,
  preserving the pre-existing receipt shape for callers that never wire the
  gate
