# ci-contract-baseline Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change governance-0-ci-contract-baseline. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Governance cleanup starts from a green contract baseline

Governance PRs that change role boundaries, dead-code paths, documentation authority, or entropy automation MUST start from a passing master contract baseline. The baseline includes backend fast tests and the generated frontend types matching `openapi/nhms.v1.yaml`.

#### Scenario: generated frontend types drift blocks governance
- **WHEN** `openapi/nhms.v1.yaml` generates TypeScript that differs from `apps/frontend/src/api/types.ts`
- **THEN** the governance baseline is not satisfied and cleanup PRs MUST wait until the generated type artifact is reconciled

#### Scenario: contract tests pass before downstream governance
- **WHEN** `tests/test_api_contract.py` and `tests/test_openapi_drift.py` pass on the current branch
- **THEN** downstream governance changes may use that branch as their baseline

#### Scenario: full backend fast gate passes before downstream governance
- **WHEN** Governance-1 through Governance-4 issues are started without an explicit maintainer waiver
- **THEN** the branch has passing evidence for `uv run pytest -q -m "not e2e and not grib and not integration"` in addition to focused OpenAPI and generated-type checks

#### Scenario: frontend contract generation check passes before downstream governance
- **WHEN** Governance-1 through Governance-4 issues are started without an explicit maintainer waiver
- **THEN** `cd apps/frontend && corepack pnpm run check:api-types` passes or equivalent CI evidence proves generated frontend types match the committed OpenAPI contract

### Requirement: Python tooling commands use the repository-managed environment

Developer entrypoints for backend Python work MUST use `uv run` so local, CI, and production-like checks resolve the same locked environment.

#### Scenario: Makefile test and lint targets use uv
- **WHEN** a developer runs `make test` or `make lint`
- **THEN** the underlying commands run through `uv run pytest` and `uv run ruff check .`

#### Scenario: Makefile app and migration targets use uv
- **WHEN** a developer runs `make dev`, `make migrate`, `make seed-demo`, or `make seed-m1-model`
- **THEN** Python modules are invoked through `uv run python -m ...`

#### Scenario: Makefile reset-db preserves uv-backed child targets
- **WHEN** a developer inspects or runs `make reset-db`
- **THEN** the target preserves the existing database drop/create sequence and invokes `$(MAKE) migrate` and `$(MAKE) seed-demo`, so migration and seed Python modules run through the uv-backed child targets
