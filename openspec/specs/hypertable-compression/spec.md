# hypertable-compression Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change cleanup-orphan-execution-audit-validator. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: The compression live-evidence module MUST NOT retain unwired trust-boundary validators

The compression live-evidence validation module SHALL NOT contain
validator functions asserting a trust boundary that no execution path
enforces: when a validation lane is replaced (as `aace0913` replaced the
pgaudit lane with the supervisor-owned execution lane), every validator
orphaned by that replacement is deleted rather than left implying an
audit gate that is not wired. Attestation fields for unwired lanes stay
schema-pinned to their honest value (`authorization.database_audit_proof`
and `execution.database_audit_proof` const `false`) rather than being
"supported" by unreachable code.

#### Scenario: aace0913 orphan validators removed

- **WHEN** the compression live-evidence module's Python sources are
  scanned for the validators orphaned by the pgaudit-lane retirement
- **THEN** `grep -rn --include="*.py"` for `_validate_execution_audit`,
  `_validate_invocation_record`, and `_artifact_refs_in` each return
  zero hits, and the `database_audit_proof` schema pins under
  `authorization` and `execution` remain `{"const": false}`

### Requirement: The G14 write-privilege probe MUST derive its target from the single recovery-target source and fail closed

The compression supervision plane SHALL embed in every
`has_write_privilege_on_target` probe (supervisor checkpoint SQL and
benchmark activity SQL) only a target that was produced by the shared
fail-closed target validator from the single recovery-target constant;
the validator SHALL raise — before any SQL is built — for any target
that is not a member of the supervised-hypertable whitelist or does not
match a strict `schema.table` identifier form. No probe SQL may embed a
target table as an independent inline literal that can drift from the
pinned recovery target.

#### Scenario: Probe target and recovery target share one source

- **WHEN** the supervisor builds its G14 checkpoint activity SQL and its
  expected decompress argv
- **THEN** both derive the hypertable schema and name from the same
  shared constant, and
  `grep -rn "has_table_privilege(usename" scripts/` returns zero hits

#### Scenario: Non-whitelisted target is refused before SQL exists

- **WHEN** the target validator is invoked with a target outside the
  supervised-hypertable whitelist or with a malformed identifier
- **THEN** it raises an error and no probe SQL is produced

#### Scenario: Switching the target moves the probe with it

- **WHEN** an activity-SQL builder is invoked with
  `met.forcing_station_timeseries`
- **THEN** the emitted SQL probes write privilege on
  `met.forcing_station_timeseries` and no longer references
  `hydro.river_timeseries`

### Requirement: The recovery-target six-field contract MUST have a single Python source bound to the schema consts by an automated guard

The recovery target SHALL be defined as one six-field contract
(hypertable schema and name, chunk schema and name, range start and
end) with a single Python source of truth; the supervisor expected
decompress argv and the capture evidence target SHALL derive from that
source, and an automated guard SHALL assert field-by-field equality
between the source and the bound copy set — the schema consts that pin
the same values, the synthetic `decompress_return_relation` const, and
the verifier's recovery-target module constants — so that mutating any
copy in that set alone fails a test instead of shipping a half-migrated
target. Copies that cannot derive from the source directly MAY instead
be covered by a test whose failure is triggered by a one-sided change
(direct equality assertion or a gate test the copy flows through), and
any copy known to remain outside the bound set MUST be named in the
source-of-truth documentation with a tracked follow-up.

#### Scenario: All six schema consts and the verifier oracle are bound to the shared source

- **WHEN** the drift-guard test compares the schema
  `recovery_target` consts, `decompress_return_relation`, and the
  verifier's recovery-target oracle against the shared contract
  constants
- **THEN** all six fields and the synthetic `chunk_schema.chunk_name`
  relation match field-by-field, and changing any one copy alone makes
  a test fail

#### Scenario: Supervisor argv and capture evidence derive from the source

- **WHEN** the supervisor builds its expected decompress argv and the
  capture producer emits its recovery-target evidence and preflight SQL
- **THEN** the chunk schema, chunk name, range start, and range end come
  from the shared constants and their rendered content is unchanged for
  the pinned values

#### Scenario: The capture catalog_post SQL derives from the shared source

- **WHEN** the capture producer renders its catalog_post SQL for the
  pinned recovery target
- **THEN** the six identity fields are interpolated from the derived
  recovery-target mapping, the rendered string is byte-identical to the
  pre-derivation literal, and the `capture:catalog_post` marker remains
  the first token

#### Scenario: The verifier decompress argv tail derives from its own bound constant

- **WHEN** the verifier validates a decompress invocation argv
- **THEN** the expected tail is built from the verifier's own
  recovery-target constant (itself guard-bound to the shared source),
  an argv derived from that constant is accepted, and an argv whose
  tail deviates in any single recovery-target field is rejected

#### Scenario: The replay producer's target derives from the shared source

- **WHEN** the drift-guard test compares the replay producer's module
  `TARGET` mapping and its synthetic `TARGET_RELATION` string against
  the shared contract constants
- **THEN** the six fields and the `chunk_schema.chunk_name` relation
  match field-by-field, the replay producer's own receipt test asserts
  the published target against the contract-derived expectation rather
  than the producer's own constant, and reverting the producer's
  derivation to an independent drifted literal makes a test fail

### Requirement: The schema-dump-list capture MUST refuse a docker CLI that deviates from the pinned host CLI unless an explicit self-test seam is enabled

The schema-dump-list capture SHALL enforce, in code, that the docker
CLI it executes is the same pinned host CLI its recorded forensic
argv attests (it is the capture kind that records docker invocation
argvs into the bundle): when the injected docker executable differs
from the pinned constant and the explicit self-test opt-in flag is
not set, that capture SHALL fail closed before running any subprocess
or emitting any forensic document, and the error SHALL name the
observed docker value. The self-test opt-in remains a hidden
test-only flag; the production plan author SHALL NOT emit it. Capture
kinds that run docker only to record measured container facts (no
argv attestation pair) are outside this requirement.

#### Scenario: Deviating docker without the seam is refused before any bundle write

- **WHEN** the capture producer is invoked for the schema-dump-list
  kind with a docker executable different from the pinned host CLI and
  without the self-test opt-in flag
- **THEN** it exits non-zero with an error naming the observed docker
  value, emits no forensic document on stdout, and leaves the evidence
  directory empty

#### Scenario: Hermetic self-tests keep stub-docker injection via the explicit opt-in

- **WHEN** a hermetic test appends the self-test opt-in flag to the
  schema-dump-list capture argv and injects a stub docker
- **THEN** the capture succeeds, the recorded forensic argv still
  names the pinned host CLI, and the existing verifier literal pins
  accept the document unchanged

#### Scenario: The production default path is unaffected

- **WHEN** the capture producer runs with the docker executable equal
  to the pinned host CLI and no opt-in flag
- **THEN** behavior is unchanged from before the guard
