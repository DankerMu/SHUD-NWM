# production-scheduler-orchestration Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change m20-production-multibasin-continuous-automation. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Backend scheduler entrypoint

The system SHALL provide a backend scheduler entrypoint that can run once or continuously and create production forecast work for all selected registered basins.

#### Scenario: one-shot scheduler pass

WHEN an operator runs the scheduler in one-shot mode
THEN it scans configured GFS/IFS cycles, resolves active basin/model candidates, records a pass summary, and exits with non-zero status only for scheduler-level failures or configured fatal candidate failures.

#### Scenario: continuous scheduler pass

WHEN the scheduler runs continuously
THEN it uses a lock or equivalent lease to prevent concurrent duplicate scans
AND it records each pass start, finish, candidate count, and selected/skipped/failed counts.

### Requirement: Full production chain orchestration

For each selected candidate, the scheduler SHALL orchestrate download, canonical conversion, forcing production, SHUD execution, output parsing, frequency/display publication, and evidence publication using existing service and worker contracts.

#### Scenario: complete candidate chain

WHEN a candidate completes successfully
THEN raw/canonical/forcing artifacts, hydro run output, parsed river timeseries, and display/frequency product state are persisted
AND the final run status is queryable by backend APIs.

#### Scenario: missing optional display input

WHEN frequency curves or warning thresholds are unavailable for a basin
THEN publication records an explicit quality or unavailable state
AND does not fabricate return periods or warning levels.
