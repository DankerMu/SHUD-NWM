# production-scheduler-orchestration Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change m20-production-multibasin-continuous-automation. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Backend scheduler entrypoint

The system SHALL provide a backend scheduler entrypoint that can run once or continuously and create production forecast work for all selected registered basins.

#### Scenario: one-shot scheduler pass

WHEN an operator runs the scheduler in one-shot mode
THEN it scans configured GFS/IFS cycles, resolves active basin/model candidates, records a pass summary, and exits with non-zero status only for scheduler-level failures or configured fatal candidate failures.

#### Scenario: continuous scheduler pass

WHEN the scheduler runs continuously
THEN it uses a lock or equivalent lease to prevent concurrent duplicate scans
AND it records each pass start, finish, candidate count, and selected/skipped/failed counts.

### Requirement: Full production chain orchestration

For each selected candidate, the scheduler SHALL orchestrate download, canonical conversion, forcing production, SHUD execution, output parsing, display publication, and evidence publication using existing service and worker contracts.

#### Scenario: complete candidate chain

WHEN a candidate completes successfully
THEN raw/canonical/forcing artifacts, hydro run output, parsed river timeseries, and display product state are persisted
AND the final run status is queryable by backend APIs.

#### Scenario: retired supplemental products remain absent

WHEN retired supplemental products are absent for a basin
THEN display publication still depends on parsed q_down readiness
AND does not fabricate retired supplemental products.
